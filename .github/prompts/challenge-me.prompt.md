# Challenge My Thinking

I'm about to make a decision or take an approach. Help me stress-test it.

## Questions to Ask Me

### Clarify the Goal
- What problem are you actually solving?
- How will you know when it's solved?
- What does success look like? Can you give a concrete example?

### Challenge Assumptions
- What are you assuming that might not be true?
- What evidence supports your approach?
- What would change your mind?

### Explore Alternatives
- What other approaches did you consider?
- What's the simplest thing that could possibly work?
- What would you do if you had half the time? Double the time?

### Identify Risks
- What could go wrong?
- What's the worst case if this approach fails?
- Is this reversible? What's the cost of being wrong?

### Surface Trade-offs
- What are you optimizing for?
- What are you giving up to get that?
- Is that the right trade-off for this situation?

Don't give me answers. Help me find better questions.

What decision or approach should we examine?
