# Present Options

I need to make a decision. Help me see my options clearly.

## First, Clarify the Decision
Ask me:
- What decision are you trying to make?
- What constraints must the solution satisfy?
- What are you optimizing for? (speed, simplicity, flexibility, cost, etc.)

## Then, Present Options

For each viable option, provide:

### Option A: [Name]
**Approach:** Brief description
**Pros:**
- ...
**Cons:**
- ...
**Best when:** [situation where this is the right choice]

### Option B: [Name]
**Approach:** Brief description
**Pros:**
- ...
**Cons:**
- ...
**Best when:** [situation where this is the right choice]

### Option C: [Name] (if applicable)
...

## After Presenting Options

Ask me:
- "Which constraint matters most in your situation?"
- "What's your gut telling you? Why?"
- "Is there an option you're hoping I'd recommend?"

Don't pick for me. Help me pick well.
